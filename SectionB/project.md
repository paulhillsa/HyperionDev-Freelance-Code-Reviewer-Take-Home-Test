### Solution

Below is the link to my project submission that I am proud of.

I am proud of this project because it contains all of the functionality that I had learned over the course of my HyperionDev bootcamp. It was awesome to great something which displayed the sum total of all that I had learnt. It also gave me the confidence to believe that I can do it and apply my knowledge to other Web Development projects.

This is a full MERN stack web app with JWT authentication for both admin and user privileges. 

Please follow the instructions given in project repo (specifically those under app usage) to be able to run and test the project on your local machine.

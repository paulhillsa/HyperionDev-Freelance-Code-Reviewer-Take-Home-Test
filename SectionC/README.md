## Section C: Code Challenge
### Instructions
- We suggest that you implement your solution in either Python, Java, Ruby or TypeScript.
- You're more than welcome to use any programming language and paradigm that you fancy as long as your solution is idiomatic.
- You are required to include a test suite for your solution.
- Please include all instructions and scripts necessary to build, test and run your solution on Linux, macOS and Windows operating systems.
- Please include a Markdown report that specifies and justifies the worst-case space complexity of your solution.
- Please attempt any one option of the alternatives available from below:

### Chosen option:

### My Solution

Please see sectionC.js to view my solution. 

I wrote my program in JavaScript, although I know that it is not a suggested language as mentioned above. 

However, it is the language I am most comfortable with.

I would like to up-skill in TypeScript in the near future. But for sake of the time constraint for this take home test I have chosen to complete my task in JavaScript.I hope that this is appropriate and my reasoning understood. 

Thank you.

### Run my program:

#### Terminal / Command prompt

Steps :
- Open Terminal or Command Prompt.
- Set Path to where File is Located (using cd).
- Type “node sectionC.js” and press Enter.

#### Using Code Runner Extension

Steps:
- Open Visual Studio Code
- Install Code Runner Extension to run JavaScript code without having to open the console and call Node.js manually.
- After you installed the extension, you just need to open the context menu on the JavaScript file you want to run with right-click, then click on the Run Code menu.
- But internally, Code Runner also looks for Node.js that’s installed on your local machine, so you need to install Node.js either way.

#### To run the test suite please see the steps below.

### Testing code:

I had written my own testing suite via the use of console.log()'s to display this. 

However, I have written and applied test via Mocha to test my algorithm as I believe this is what was expected. 

Therefore to test my program follow the following steps:

- Clone SectionC directory to your local machine
- via Terminal / Command Prompt type ``` npm i ``` to install the Mocha testing dependency.
- Next in either Terminal/Command Prompt type ```npm test``` to run the tests
- Your Terminal/Command Prompt should state that 5/5 test were successful

*To view the tests in more detail please see ./SectionC/test/test.js

### Worst-case space complexity of my solution

Space Complexity: The space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. [Reference](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-complexity-and-space-complexity/)

I believe that the best-case scenario for my algorithm would be when either the ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 given is invalid. As this would only result in one storage of the string and a simple execution.

Therefore, logically, from the above one I would then suggest that the worst-case for my algorithm would be when the algorithm is given a valid ISBN-10 which would need to be converted to ISBN-13 as this would result in the most operations performed by the algorithm.

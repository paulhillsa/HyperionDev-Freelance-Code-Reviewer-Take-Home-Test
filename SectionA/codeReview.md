## Code Review

### Solution

Hey *name_of_student*,

Great progress on the task so far! 

Just a couple of small issues that can easily be fixed.

### Indentation:

Indentation in Python matters because indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Indentation in Python is important because Python does not make use of curly brackets {} to determine the part of code. Instead it uses indentation to understand if the code is part of a function, loop, condition, etc.

On lines 2-10 of your program we run into an indentation problem that can be easily resolved. One can either remove indentation or add indentation to particular lines to form code blocks in Python.

Be mindful of which blocks of code you would like to create and then make use of indentation to do so to simply solve this issue.

Please check out these reputable resources on this issue for greater understanding on this issue:

### Logic error:

On line 5 of your program there is a logical error that can be simply resolved. 

If you were to run the Visual Studio's Code debugger on your program one can see that there is an issue on line 5 in the fact that the sorted function expected 1 argument however received 0 arguments.

Think about which argument or parameters you would like to pass through to your sorted function to resolve this issue.

Also a helpful hint is to make good use of the debugger in your chosen IDE. This will be of great benefit, as it can help guide you in resolving your program's errors.

Check out this video by Visual Studio Code on how to make use of the debugging feature:

### Readability:

Please ensure that you make proper use of comments and the use of descriptive names for function names and variables in your code. 

This will lead to greater readability and clarity of the code, which is highly important especially when working on code in a team environment with other developers. 

Here are some style guides by PEP8 that can help in this regard:

[Naming Conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)

### Overall
Well done and keep up the good work, just special emphasis must be put on documentation of your code and once you have sorted the issues highlighted here the style, efficiency and correctness of your code will be greatly improved! 

Make use of the resources and advice given here, resubmit and I am sure that you will be able to successfully complete this task.

I look forward to your next submission.
